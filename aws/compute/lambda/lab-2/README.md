## What is AWS Step Functions Service?
taken from this [AWS Documentation site](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html)

"Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that lets you combine [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions and other AWS services to build business-critical applications. Through Step Functions' graphical console, you see your applicationâ€™s workflow as a series of event-driven steps.

Step Functions is based on state machines and tasks. A state machine is a workflow. A task is a state in a workflow that represents a single unit of work that another AWS service performs. Each step in a workflow is a state.

With Step Functions' built-in controls, you examine the state of each step in your workflow to make sure that your application runs in order and as expected. Depending on your use case, you can have Step Functions call AWS services, such as Lambda, to perform tasks. You can create workflows that process and publish machine learning models. You can have Step Functions control AWS services, such as AWS Glue, to create extract, transform, and load (ETL) workflows. You also can create long-running, automated workflows for applications that require human interaction."
